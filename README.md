# Virtual Client & VS Code Extension

[Virtual Client](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient) is a cloud-ready, cross-platform workload automation tool from Microsoft Azure teams. It enables you to evaluate system performance using curated, expert-crafted profiles for CPU, GPU, memory, storage, network, and more, on Windows and Linux (x64/ARM64). See the [official documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient/docs/guides/0010-command-line/) for full details and command-line options.

## Virtual Client Executor VS Code Extension

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to manage remote machines, schedule and execute Virtual Client workloads, and monitor execution steps in real timeâ€”all from within VS Code.

### Features

- Add and manage remote machines (with credentials securely stored)
- Schedule and execute Virtual Client runs on remote Windows machines via SSH
- Real-time step-by-step status updates for each scheduled run (including transfer, extraction, and execution)
- View logs and execution output directly in VS Code
- Cancel scheduled runs
- View detailed run history and logs in a webview
- Tree views for both machines and scheduled runs

### Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.60+
- Remote machines must be accessible via SSH (Windows with PowerShell recommended)
- Virtual Client package (zip) available locally
- See [Virtual Client Requirements](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient/docs/overview/) for supported platforms and prerequisites

### Usage

1. **Add a Machine:**
   - Open the "Machines" view and click the + button to add a new machine (name, IP, username, password).
2. **Run Virtual Client:**
   - Select a machine and choose "Run Virtual Client". Fill in the package path, platform, and command-line options (see [Command Line Reference](https://microsoft.github.io/VirtualClient/docs/guides/0010-command-line/)).
   - Submit to schedule a run. The run will appear in the "Scheduled Runs" tree and update in real time.
3. **Monitor Runs:**
   - Watch each step update (directory creation, transfer, extraction, execution) in both the tree and webview.
   - View logs and output after completion.
4. **Cancel Runs:**
   - Right-click a scheduled run to cancel/remove it.
