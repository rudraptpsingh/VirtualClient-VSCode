- **Storage:** Disk I/O and storage performance tests
- **Benchmarking:** Standard benchmark suites
- **Custom:** User-defined templates

### Template Features
- **Save Current Configuration:** Turn any run configuration into a reusable template
- **Quick Load:** Select templates from categorized dropdown menus
- **Usage Tracking:** See how often templates are used and when they were last accessed
- **Import/Export:** Share templates with team members via JSON files

### Predefined Templates
The extension comes with several predefined templates for common scenarios:
- **High CPU Load Test:** Intensive CPU workload with OpenSSL benchmarks
- **Memory Stress Test:** Memory allocation and usage testing
- **Network Performance Test:** Network throughput and latency measurements
- **Storage I/O Test:** Disk read/write performance evaluation
- **Security Baseline:** Basic security-focused workload execution

## Troubleshooting
- **SSH Connection Issues:** Ensure the remote machine is reachable and SSH password authentication is enabled.
- **Virtual Client Not Found:** Make sure the package path is correct and the tool is present after extraction.
